# Random Password Regenerizer

## An Idle Hands Deployment

### Homework #3

This is a small application to quickly generate a random password using a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user has the ability to choose which to include, as well as to define how long they wish the password to be (between 8 and 128 characters).

Each character in the password is uniquely and randomly generated from the defined parameters, and then output on a prompt for the user to copy. Closing the prompt destroys this password forever.

The application will stop and alert the user if they have made an error in attempting to define the parameters of the password outside of the stated capabilities and bounds of the generator.

There are no special software or hardware requirements, just a modern browser and a working finger will suffice. This application is also mobile-friendly.

Enjoy the colorful layout and smooth interface as you abuse this application for an end-goal that you could achieve yourself by mashing a keyboard in ten seconds, as it took me many frustrating laborious hours to design and debug.
